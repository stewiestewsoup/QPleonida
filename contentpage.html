                <p><h2>Intro</h2>Have you ever wondered if the type of nutrition or diet an animal possess is related to
                    their physical characteristics? Which continents can these animals be seen?
                    Our project aims to provide the audience a dataset filled with information on some of
                    the different animals that are seen in the different continents of the world. Our dataset
                    composes of the physical characteristics an animal has. Animals are multicellular and eukaryotic
                    organisms, with few exceptions, animals consume organic material, has the capability to
                    breathe oxygen, able to move, and can reproduce sexually. As of the year 2022, 2.16 million
                    living animal species have been described. (Animal Information Dataset, 2023)</p>

                    are able to fend off for themselves.Our dataset consists of 148 animals that are found in the different parts of the world.
                    Different characteristics such as an animal’s height, weight, as well as, the countries they are
                    usually found in. The data was taken around 2022 and was updated a month ago. The reason as
                    to why we chose this data among the other data is because one of us is genuinely curious about
